# CSS

Read and follow the
[CSS Syntax section of Mark Otto’s (@mdo) code guide]
(http://codeguide.co/#http://codeguide.co/#css-syntax).
We don’t follow much of what comes after the Syntax section, so the rest
can be skipped.

We are currently using
[PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss/)
with
[narwin-pack](https://github.com/cirroweb/narwin-pack). However, some of our older
projects are still written in Sass/SCSS.

## Selector Order

Order things in HTML order unless it makes more sense to do it
alphabetically.

## Declaration Order

Declarations should first be consistent with the rest of the
application. After that it should be in order of what affects height.

`margin`
`padding`
`display`
`position`
`top`
`right`
`bottom`
`left`
`float`
`overflow`
`border`
`border-radius`
`background`
`font`
`line-height`
`color`
`letter-spacing`
`transitions`

If there is a shorthand version for that set of styles, follow in the
order of the shorthand. For `margin` that would be `margin-top`,
`margin-right`, `margin-bottom` then `margin-left`. For `border` that
would be `border-width`, `border-style` then `border-color`.
